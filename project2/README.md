#Project 2: Connectivity (module 11)

Codes used for connectivity analysis (spectral coherence and phase-slope index) on hippocampus and ventral stiatrum LFPs using data sessions from R020 from vandermeer lab server. 
  
Run master_ConnectivityAnalysis.m (replace code and data paths with yours) with following steps:
- Some initial path settings
- Define and cd to R020 data folder

For each data session: compute and plot
  * Overall comparison of HC-Str spectral coherence
  * Task-based spectral coherence using fieldtrip
  * Task-based phase-slope index (psi) using fieldtrip

Used MATLAB R2015a running on Mac OS X
